Normal Template
===============

Normal templates are simple, yet powerful. They are safe, usable in non XML/HTML contexts and portable to any programming language. Normal templates can be used at client or server side.

This package contains a CommonJS compatible JavaScript implementation. It is part of the [Nitro](http://www.nitrojs.org/) ecosystem of Web Application development tools. For extra convenience, a jQuery plugin is also included.

A Python port is available at: [http://github.com/tkouts/py-normal-template](http://github.com/tkouts/py-normal-template)
